# How To Install and Run

1. ### `yarn` or `npm install`
    To set up the environment dependencies ( node version 5++ )

2. ###  `yarn start` or `npm run start`
    Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

3. ### `npm run build`
    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
    Your app is ready to be deployed!
